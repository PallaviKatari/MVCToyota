🟦 PART 1 — Create a New MVC Project (Explained in Detail)
✅ Step 1: Install the .NET SDK

To build and run .NET MVC applications, your computer needs the .NET SDK (Software Development Kit).

🔗 Download page:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download

The SDK includes:

C# compiler

ASP.NET MVC libraries

Dotnet CLI (dotnet command)

Templates (like MVC, Razor Pages, API)

After installing, check your version:

dotnet --version


If you see a version number (like 8.0.x), everything is ready.

✅ Step 2: Create a folder for your MVC app

You usually keep each project in its own folder.

mkdir MyMvcApp
cd MyMvcApp


Now you're inside your empty project directory.

✅ Step 3: Create a brand-new MVC project
dotnet new mvc -n MyMvcApp

💡 What this command means:

dotnet new mvc → create a new MVC web application with controllers & views

-n MyMvcApp → sets the project name

It creates a folder named MyMvcApp containing the project files

So inside this folder you will get:

Controllers/ → Handles user requests

Views/ → Razor pages seen by the user

wwwroot/ → CSS, JS, images

Program.cs → Entry point for your web server

MyMvcApp.csproj → Project file listing dependencies

Move into that folder:

cd MyMvcApp

✅ Step 4: Run the MVC app locally
dotnet run


You will see messages like:

Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
Now listening on: https://localhost:7000


This means:

http://localhost:5000 → HTTP version (no encryption)

https://localhost:7000 → HTTPS version (secure)

Open the browser → You will see the default MVC website.

Stop it with:

Ctrl + C

🟦 PART 2 — Containerize the MVC App (Explained Deeply)

Here we convert your MVC application into a Docker image so it can run in a container.

A Dockerfile tells Docker how to build the image.

✅ Step 5: Create a Dockerfile

🖥️ Using Command Prompt (Windows)
Create an empty Dockerfile:

cmd
echo. > Dockerfile
This makes a blank file named Dockerfile in the current directory.

Go into your project folder where .csproj is.

Create a file named Dockerfile (no extension!) and paste:

# Build Stage
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src

# copy csproj and restore dependencies
COPY *.csproj ./
RUN dotnet restore

# copy everything and publish
COPY . ./
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /app/publish

# Runtime Stage
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/publish .

EXPOSE 80
ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:80

ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyMvcApp.dll"]

🔍 Understanding every section
🔹 1. FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0 AS build

Use the .NET SDK image to:

Restore NuGet packages

Compile your code

Publish it

This container has the full compiler and tools.

🔹 2. *COPY .csproj ./

Copies only the .csproj file.
Docker does this so restore can run before copying all files (faster builds).

🔹 3. RUN dotnet restore

Downloads all NuGet dependencies.

🔹 4. COPY . ./

Copies the entire project folder into the container.

🔹 5. RUN dotnet publish

Produces compiled output in /app/publish.

🔹 6. FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:9.0 AS final

This is the runtime image:

Much smaller

Only includes ASP.NET runtime

Does NOT include build tools

This keeps your final image lightweight.

🔹 7. COPY --from=build /app/publish .

Copies the published output from the build stage.

🔹 8. EXPOSE 80

Tells Docker the app listens on port 80 (not required but helpful).

🔹 9. ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MVCDemo.dll"]

This runs the app when the container starts.

✅ Step 6: Create .dockerignore

This file tells Docker what NOT to copy into the image.

Create .dockerignore:

bin/
obj/
.vs/
*.user
*.suo
node_modules/


This speeds up Docker builds and keeps the image smaller.

🟦 PART 3 — Build & Run the Docker Container (Full Explanation)
✅ Step 7: Build the Docker image

Open terminal INSIDE the project folder (where the Dockerfile is):

docker build -t my-mvc-app .

🔍 What happens during build:

Docker reads Dockerfile

Creates build environment

Restores NuGet packages

Compiles your MVC app

Publishes output

Copies published files into final image

Creates the final image named my-mvc-app

Confirm the image is created:

docker images

✅ Step 8: Run the container
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-mvc-container my-mvc-app

🔍 What this means:

-d → run in background

-p 8080:80

Left side = your computer (port 8080)

Right side = inside container (port 80)

--name my-mvc-container → easier to manage

my-mvc-app → your image name

Now open:

👉 http://localhost:8080

You will see your MVC app running inside Docker.
